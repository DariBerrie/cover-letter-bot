# cover-letter-bot

The idea for a cover letter generator came from the multitude of LinkedIn posts and news articles about the recent tech layoffs that have directly affected thousands and will impact much more. During the same period, there were many articles discussing how ChatGPT was going to change...everything. I wanted to test out the offerings of OpenAI, and this seemed like a simple way to do so while poking fun at the job hiring process that so many are about to experience.

I used primarily React for the front-end, but needed to use some Node.js to use OpenAI's API to create the completion for my cover letter prompt.

New features to consider:
I'm still considering new features like being able to copy the text once generated, or having it appear it a text editor that can then be copied or exported to a Word or Open Office document. I also wanted to make the information more tailored to the particular user by perhaps scanning a LinkedIn Resume PDF.
